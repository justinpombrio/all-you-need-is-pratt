//! Panfix is a new approach to parsing, using a modified version of [operator precedence
//! grammars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator-precedence_grammar). It:

//! - (TODO) Question: how complicated of a grammar can it handle?
//! - Runs in linear time.
//! - Can gracefully handle some kinds of parse errors, producing (TODO) excellent error messages
//! in those cases.
//!
//! This crate is incomplete, and in a messy state. For now, you should use the reference
//! implementation:
//!
//! [**Reference Implementation**](refn_impl)
//!
//! Below is information about the (incomplete!) more robust/efficient implementation.

//!
//! The Panfix parser is here. It is probably what you want to view:
//!
//! [**â˜ž The Panfix Parser**](parsing)
//!
//! The parser is made up of three pieces. If you want more control over the parsing process,
//! you can use or replace any combination of these pieces (they are all independent). Here are the
//! pieces, in the order that they run in the parsing pipeline:
//!
//! 1. [Lexing](lexing)
//! 2. [Shunting](shunting)
//! 3. [Visiting](rpn_visitor)
